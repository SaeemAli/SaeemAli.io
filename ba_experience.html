                <h4> Data Science Experience with British Airways</h4>
                <p> 
                    This virtual experience gives an insight into life in British Airways as a data scientist 
                    and the types of tasks you would be undertaking. It tests your skills in both analytics and 
                    predictive modeling. Click 
                    <a href="https://github.com/SaeemAli/BA_data_science" target="_blank">here</a> to view my code.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The first task is to create a web scraper to retrieve reviews of British Airways from a flight
                    review site, <a href="https://www.airlinequality.com/" id="link" target="_blank">SKYTRAX</a>.
                    The script I created gathers not only the user's review but additional 
                    information like the flight class and purpose of travel. The purpose of gathering this data is to
                    analyse thousands of reviews and get an idea of how customers viewed their experience with British 
                    Airways. To do this, I used a method called sentiment analysis which is to take some text to decide
                    how positive or negative the text is. This helps us to understand the overall feeling customers had
                    during their flight without having to read every review. Using the information from the web scraper,
                    I broke down the reviews by seat class to see if the class the passenger flew on had an impact on
                    their review.

                <p>
                    This graph shows that the passengers in first class generally had a better experience than those
                    in other classes. This indicates that British Airways should put more enphasis on improve the 
                    other classes which are seemingly falling behind in quality.

                    The second task was to find out how likely a customer is to book a ticket based on various factors.
                    We were given a dataset of 50,000 bookings that customers either made or ended up not making.
                    The factors to consider included number of passengers, country of booking, class and whether the 
                    customer wanted additional baggage. This was done using predictive modelling. I used the first
                    40,000 bookings to train the model, this gives it an understanding of how each factor influcences
                    the customer's decision. Then it predicted the decision of the last 10,000 bookings with a high 
                    degree of accuracy. The goal of this task was to find out whether this dataset was useful in
                    predicted a customer's decision. My model proves that it is useful as it could anticipate the user's 
                    decision in most cases, therefore making it a good indication of future bookings.
